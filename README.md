# ECE143project

This is the repo for team 12- ECE 143 sp18 team project

NOTE: For some reason geographic plots are not being displayed on github hence to kae it easy for viewing on github we uploaded a new version "Analysis of Startups and Investors (version for viewing on github).ipynb" in which we included the images after saving them initially, so in case you intend to see the results on github itself instead of running the notebook again kindly refer to this file!

The link to the data set is: https://github.com/notpeter/crunchbase-data <br>
We use companies.csv and investments.csv files for our analysis after pre-processing them as explained in the notebook.
